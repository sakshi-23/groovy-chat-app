In this book I examine the ways that technology design can provoke and engage the political. I explore the political qualities and potentials of design by examining a series of projects that span design and art, engineering and computer science, agitprop and consumer products.\r\n\r\nI view these projects, which include computational visualizations of networks of power and influence, therapy robots that shape sociability, and everyday objects embedded with microchips that enable users to circumvent surveillance, through the lens of agonism, a political theory that emphasizes contention and dissensus as foundational to democracy. Through my analysis I aim to provide design criticism with a new approach for thinking about the relationship between forms of political expression, computation as a medium, and the processes and products of design.",

Current and imminent projects include: (1) An investigation of strategy use and selection in dynamic environments focused on critical care nurses. Our hope is to develop a methodology that allows easy elicitation of strategies from experts; to articulate how strategy selection is used to protect situation comprehension, workload, and performance; and to train novices in these expert strategies. (2) An archival study of the cognitive factors underlying rail accidents. (3) A series of experiments trying to determine the conditions to obtain\"and eliminate\"the vigilance decrement in dynamic environments like air traffic control. (4) Producing a Handbook of Human-Systems Integration . Student led projects are looking into taxonomies of human error, the psychometrics of situation awareness, complex prospective memory, predictive aiding in railway automation, the role of familiarity in driving SA, and a comparison of electronic inks.

He led a wide range of research activities in computer vision and machine learning over the next five years. His collaboration with Michael Jones resulted in a widely-used technique for detecting skin in images, which is currently used in Google Image Search. In collaboration with Vladimir Pavlovic and Kevin Murphy, Dr. Rehg pioneered the use of probabilistic graphical models (specifically, switching linear dynamic systems) in video-based tracking. His collaboration with Tat-Jen Cham on tracking Fred Astaire's dance movements resulted in one of the first applications of computer vision analysis to movie footage. In 2001, Dr. Rehg joined the College of Computing in the Georgia Institute of Technology at the rank of Associate Professor.

While not the easiest way to pursue a Ph.D., the Woodruff School afforded me the opportunity to try, and that willingness to give me the chance and let me work it out was really how I ended up at Georgia Tech. In hindsight, I didn't appreciate how hard balancing professional and academic lives would be - though the Woodruff School faculty did. I so value the guidance and advisement I was given by the faculty during my time there.  I was naturally drawn to interdisciplinary research, and found the program to be very friendly to crafting these sorts of pursuits. I minored in Management, focused my research in Bioengineering, and enjoyed a fantastic, hands-on advisor as well as a tremendous committee from other departments to help me achieve my research goals. The other students were wonderful and excellent intellectually. My lab mates were a constant source of ideas, camaraderie, and support.  When I began at the Woodruff School, one of the greatest strengths of the department was the incredible dedication and insight given to students by the Graduate Coordinator at the time, Dr. William Wepfer. With Dr. Wepfer now as the School's Chair, I expect the dedication to blending education and the student experience with top-tier research opportunities will continue. The balanced focus of the Woodruff School - the student and the research - as well as outstanding faculty, undoubtedly set the Woodruff School apart.  Though I had already been working as a professional before I came to the Woodruff School, the program there significantly increased both the breadth and depth of my experience and education. This has allowed me to craft my chosen career path and work to align much more with my personal and professional goals blending research and working with industry. I truly treasure the people I had the opportunity to work with during my degree. They enriched the experience and my life so much.",

As the amount of data available to people and organizations has skyrocketed over the past 10-20 years, largely fueled by the growth of the internet, insufficient methods for people to benefit from this flood of data have been developed. A central focus of many of the group's projects is the creation of information visualization and visual analytics tools to help people explore, analyze, and understand large data sets. In particular, they are creating visual analytics systems to help people with \"sense-making\" activities on data sets such as large document collections. The group also has developed a number of techniques and systems for providing people with peripheral awareness of useful information. Follow the link to the research group in order to visit pages with more details on these projects. John is a faculty investigator in the Dept. of Homeland Security's VACCINE Center of Excellence (GT page) focusing on developing visual analytics technologies and solutions for grand challenge problems in homeland security, and in the NSF FODAVA Center exploring the foundations of data analysis and visual analytics. He is also an affiliated faculty member in the Tennenbaum Institute at Georgia Tech.

Dr. Stasko's research group is uncovering ways to help people benefit from this flood of information. One central focus of a number of their projects is the creation of Information Visualization tools to help people understand large data sets.

Dr. Turk has explored several methods of taking a large polygonal model and creating simplified versions of the model for more rapid display. Another recent theme in his research is that model and image creation can be performed better if various aspects of people's visual perception are taken into account. Two examples of this are the high contrast display technique of his student Jack Tumblin, and the image-driven model simplification method of his student Peter Lindstrom. He has also recently been investigating the creation and manipulation of surfaces using a new form of interpolating implicit function. The resulting implicit surfaces are useful for shape transformation, for surface reconstruction from noisy data, and for the creation of implicit surfaces that match a given polygonal model. His other interests include vector field visualization, texture synthesis, and biological pattern formation.  ",
