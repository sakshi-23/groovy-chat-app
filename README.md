#GROOVY - Chat App for Gatech GVU

In this project, I have developed a conversational agent that can answer queries related to GVU. The agent is designed
keeping the primary user as someone who is interested in learning about the GVU and different
labs, people and research associated with it.

The agent is deployed in Slack as well as can be accessed using the following https://bot.api.ai/2c1b21d3-0442-4bbe-bd0a-2efa57054598 . Note because of the deployment in Heroku, the agent might take some time to start answering the questions once initiated.
